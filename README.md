# MBT_LFSR
A Verilog implementation of Multi-bit-throughput LFSR with a detailed pdf document about LFSRs for HW design engineers

Rev 2.0:
-The constraints on parameters revised and tested. Now, more throughput bits are allowed
-More tests in the testbench
-a new section in the pdf file "A non-random behavior in LFSRs" and changes because of the revised parameter constraints
